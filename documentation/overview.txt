Code overview

This document briefly describes the purpose and the organisation of Arnold. 

Arnold is a simple bittorrent implementation in Java, using the Ibis distributed
computing platform. It is intended to study policies, in particular
anonymization policies and helper selection for anonymization.
The main simplification in Arnold is that only one file can be shared at the
same time, it also takes some liberties with the bitTorrent protocol, and uses
its own `wire format' instead of the standard bitTorrent format. Apart from
these isssues it is a fully functional bitTorrent client, including anonymous
file downloading and sharing.

All java source files live in a single package, nl.tudelft.tribler.arnold.

The central file is Engine.java, which implements the main bittorrent engine
that asks for pieces from other peers, and uploads chunks to these peers.
